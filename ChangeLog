vmcatcher_eventHndl_ON-0.0.6
 * New changes introduced by Boris Parak from CESNET:
  * It is checked if there is a previous image version before attempting to upload a new version for the image. If there is a previous version it means that this image has expired and therefore
  * it is disabled before attempting to upload a new version for the image. Previous image version is disabled by changing its user, group and permissions to oneadmin and disabling the image
  * in OpenNebula (if it is possible)
  * The chown and chmod to configure the same user and group which had the previous version for the image are done separately in order to handle partial failures.

vmcatcher_eventHndl_ON-0.0.5
 * Added a LICENSE file
 * Adedd a ChangeLog file
 * New name for expired images: The expired images are named now as `$dc:identifier_EXPIRED_TIMESTAMP`. Example: `93084776-1176-4849-95dc-cc7a15f2ce97_EXPIRED_2014-06-04_12-54-44_+0200-CEST`

vmcatcher_eventHndl_ON-0.0.4
 * The image is named as `dc:identifier`

 * Now, when there is an update for a determinted image, vmcatcher_eventHndl_ON disables previous image by configuring this image with user `oneadmin` and group `oneadmin`,
 * and change its permissions in order to only user `oneadmin` can access to it. If it is possible, it also disables this previous image. Also, it configures the new version for the image 
 * with the same user, group and permissions which had been configured for its previous image. Also, if previous image had been disabled, the new version for the image is disabled. 
 * The new opperation for vmcatcher_eventHndl_ON is the following:

1. Site admin will subscribe to an image list
2. The first image is downloaded and registered, it should not be made public. It is up to the site administrator the decision of making public the image.
3. Image lives in the cloud, VMs are launched
4. VMcatcher receives an update for a determined image
5. VMcatcher_eventHndl_ON will: 

   A) Read metadata of the existing `$dc:identifier` image and **remember** owner, group, permissions and enabled/disabled status

   B) Chown & chmod the old/previous image to `oneadmin:oneadmin 700`

   C) Rename the old image to `$dc:identifier_$timestamp`

   D) Register the new image and name it as `$dc:identifier`

   E) Apply the metadata **remembered in A point**
